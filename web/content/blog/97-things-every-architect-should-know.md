As spoken by [Richard Monson-Haefel](http://www.monson-haefel.com/) at the Java User Group Meeting put on by [TekSystems](http://www.teksystems.com/). We covered ten general themes in the short amount of time we had.

*   The user interface is critical
    *   The user interface is what the user sees, it is where the rubber meets the road. It should empower the user to do his/her job.
    *   [For the end-user the interface is the system](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/for-the-end-user-the-interface-is-the-system)
*   Nothing Lasts
    *   Cobol, Smalltalk, Waterfall, nothing in software lasts. Chances are if you think it will last you just need to wait longer.
*   Data is forever
    *   Relational databases have been around a long time. Go with what works.
    *   [Its all about the data](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/it-is-all-about-the-data)
*   Flexibility breeds complexity
    *   Something that is flexible is almost always complicated, but if something is designed to be simple it can be flexible.
*   Manage your expectations
    *   Know that you can't have everything, and prepare for it
    *   [Architectural Tradeoffs](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/Architectural%20Tradeoffs<br ></a>)
*   Know thy business
    *   The business is key to making great decisions in architecture. You have a responsibility to know all of aspects of the business side and technical side. Similar to a CIO but you get paid a lot less.
    *   [Understanding the business domain](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/diligence-and-the-mundane)
*   Maintain the vision
    *   [Diligence and the mundane](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/diligence-and-the-mundane)
*   Software architects should also be coders
    *   Take some time every week to sit down with the coders. You will figure out what their pain points are and it will help you make better architectural decisions.
    *   [Share your knowledge and experience](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/share-your-knowledge-and-experiences "Share your knowledge and experience")
*   There is no substitute for experience
    *   Creating software is a trade. It is learned over time, and best learned by working with great people. It is similar to being a plumber or an electrician. You go to class for a little bit, and then you work as an apprentice. Architecture is no different.

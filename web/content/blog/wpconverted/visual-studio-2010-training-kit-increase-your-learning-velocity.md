[Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4 Training Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=752cb725-969b-4732-a383-ed5740f02e93&displaylang=en) **Jam Packed with goodness.** There are a lot of great powerpoints that summarize what's new.

Whats New In the .NET Framework 4 Whats New In Visual Studio 2010 What's New In C# 4 and Visual Basic 10 Whats New In ASP.NET AJAX 4 Whats New In ASP.NET Web Forms 4 etc.

I think the labs are a little on the weak side. There is a lab in there for [Project Velocity](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/cc655792.aspx). This was the first time I had heard of this, so I was pretty intrigued. It looks like it is a distributed cache for asp.net applications. Seems like they are taking some of [Scale-out](http://www.scaleoutsoftware.com/)'s business. I was hoping for more stuff on the new language features, like the new [dynamic type](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741(VS.100).aspx).

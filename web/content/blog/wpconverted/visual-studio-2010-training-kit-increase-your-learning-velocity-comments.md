(Electronics) Ordered on 10-29 and received on 11-2, this eanertxl burner is a great addition to my Asus netbook. Installation was simple and it came with the Power2Go software. It works much better than I expected. I have had no problems burning CD/DVDs (so far).

#10 love it. I wish that my glamours job of stay at home mom would allow me to wear this to say the grreocy store or parent teacher meetings but I am pretty sure i would get some strange looks in my sweats death eater tshirt and rainbow eyes.

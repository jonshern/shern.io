After many years of talking about phase two of the [Mall of America](http://www.mallofamerica.com/about_moa_phase_II.aspx) itÂ is finally starting to move. I heard through the grapevine that each parking spot costs $25000. Wow that is a lot of money, and there will be about 7000 spots. So just giving people room to park will cost 175 million dollars, and they say mass transit is expensive:)

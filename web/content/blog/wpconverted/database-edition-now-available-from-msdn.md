Just noticed that Database Edition is available to download with my msdn subscription. Before it was about $3000 to buy, I wonder why there are just giving it away now? I supect it has to do with the fact that currect dbas are heavily entrenched in their tools and practices, and don't want to change.Â  By giving it away for free, they can get the developers on board and get them to show the dbas how nice the tool works.

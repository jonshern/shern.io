For a few days now, I have noticed that my mac has been running very very hot.Â  Around 160 Degrees fahrenheit. I noticed that the cpu is pegged. I think since it is dual core the system doesn't hang so it was not noticeable in regards to performance. The culprit was the print queue. I killed it a few times and it came right back. I looked at the print queue and there were a couple of jobs stuck in there. I deleted them and cpu went back down to normal. I am already noticing a big difference in both temperature and battery life.

Google just released there new browser [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) It is beatifully simple piece of coding, in which each tab is broken into its own process. Each process can then spawn child process which correspond to various plugins, such as [shockwave flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/shockwaveplayer/), etc. This is a great way to isolate your processes from other errors, essentially it is a mini-os wrapped in a browser. This can be a difficult concept to wrap your head around and the cartoon that was produced is an excellent way to understand the nuts and bolts. **Some cartoons that convey difficult concepts.** [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/) [Why we need architects](http://www.skyscrapr.net/blogs/video/archive/2006/03/10/46.aspx) [What is perpendicular storage](http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html) [Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns/dp/0596007124) SOA is something that is often defined using analogies such as Legos, Â Transportation, or the post office. It pays to think of things at their simplest level, it will really be helpful for you when attempting to convince others or your brilliance:)

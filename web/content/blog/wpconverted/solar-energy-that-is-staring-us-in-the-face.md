**Printed Solar Panels**  Tomorrow's solar panels may not need to be produced in high-vacuum conditions in billion-dollar fabrication facilities. If California-based Nanosolar has its way, plants will use a nanostructured "ink" to form semiconductors, which would be printed on flexible sheets. Nanosolar is currently building a plant that will print 430 megawatts' worth of solar cells annually—more than triple the current solar output of the entire country.  Eventually we can just roll out the solar panels on every home in the US.  A major step toward a distributed energy grid. I think this is a pretty exciting innovation, then again maybe I am just a geek:)

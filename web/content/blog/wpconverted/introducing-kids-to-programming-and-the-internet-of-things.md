This Christmas I am looking to introduce some of the kids in my family to the world of programming and the Internet of Things. (Devices that can do stuff, like hit a button and make an LED light up) I am not 100% where to start, but I am thinking about first starting out with some basic electronics, moving to programming and then combining them. This is going to be a multi-year process. Since this stuff is not necessarily easy. ![](http://jonsherndotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/120715_0249_introducing1.png)

### Basic Electronics

* * *

There is a pretty clear winner out there for starting the journey into electronics. [Snap Circuits SC-300 Electronics Discovery Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CIXVIRQ/ref=s9_simh_gw_p21_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=19ERFAR6PMZQQMT6BJJX&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop) ![81shxf4iitl-_sl1500_](https://jonsherndotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/81shxf4iitl-_sl1500_.jpg) The snap circuits have won many awards including: The National Parenting Center-Seal of Approval, Dr. Toy 100 Best Children's Products, Dr Toy Best Educational Products

### **Basic Programming**

* * *

*   [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
    *   Scratch has been around a while and was developed by the MIT Media Lab
    *   They have a vibrant community with lots of examples.
*   [Touch Develop](https://www.touchdevelop.com/)
    
    *   Developed by Microsoft.
    *   They have a partnership with the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) project that is rolling out about a million devices across the UK schools.
    *   The video and editor are easy to use.
*   [Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/) This one was is used by code.org and comes with a bunch of great lessons.
    
    *   There is a [minecraft](https://code.org/mc) themed lesson, that would appeal to a whole lot of kids.
    *   There are many very user friendly lessons.
        

![](https://jonsherndotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/mc_wide_big_2_v4.jpg) Each programming environment works with various devices. So it important to know which device each works with, to understand the long term capability.

### **Programming and Devices**

* * *

#### The Pi's

*   [Raspberry Pi 2 Base Kit](http://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Original-Preloaded/dp/B008XVAVAW)  -- $69.99

*   [Raspberry Pi 2 Ultimate Kit](http://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Ultimate-Starter-Components/dp/B00G1PNG54/ref=sr_1_6?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1449418718&sr=1-6&keywords=raspberry+pi+starter+kit) - $84.99
    
    *   Includes Buttons/LED/Breadboard

#### Arduino

*   [Budget pack for Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/products/193) -- $49.95
    
    *   It comes with some LEDS/Buttons/Breadboard/etc.
*   The [Starter Pack](http://www.adafruit.com/products/68) – $64.95
    
    *   It comes with a lot more including a shield. It is $64.95

  

**Programming Environment**

**Raspberry Pi 2**

**arduino**

Scratch

[Great support](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-scratch/) You can use scratch on the raspberry pi with no computer.

[Experimental](http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Scratch)

Touch Develop

[A bit of work](https://www.touchdevelop.com/docs/raspberry-pi-setup)

[A bit of work](https://www.touchdevelop.com/docs/getting-started-with-arduino)

Code Studio

Scratch also works with something called the [PicoBoard](http://www.picocricket.com/picoboard.html)  ![pbarrowsusb](https://jonsherndotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/pbarrowsusb.jpg) It is not a full board and requires a computer to really do anything. It is a start, but you would end up buying an Arduino or Raspberry Pi if you wanted to do something serious. **Other Devices  ** I have had a gadgeteer board for a couple of years now. To be exact it is the [FEZ Spider](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/543), but it is way more expensive ($149.99) and you are asking a kid or parent to download and setup visual studio.  It can be messy. Before Windows 10 IoT it was really the best option to build and deploy .Net code to a device and watch it run. I will say I am biased towards Microsoft technologies, and that is mainly because I want to be able to provide some guidance and tech support. ![](http://jonsherndotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/120715_0249_introducing2.png) **My Recommendation is to go with scratch and the raspberry pi.** Raspberry Pi has great support and it ends up to be a computer you can put in your pocket. Plug an Hdmi into and program on your tv.

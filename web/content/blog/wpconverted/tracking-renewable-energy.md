The great plains institute just released news of a new software called [M-RETS](http://www.mrets.net/)(Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System). Basically it is a app that allows Minnesota, Wisconson, Iowa, and Manitoba to trade renewable energy in a market type scenario.Â  This will function to keep the cost down, and encourage the use and development of more renewables. I think this initiative will go along way in providing the necessary push we need to move in the direction of renewable energy.

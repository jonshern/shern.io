Towards a shared unnrtseandidg and increased ownershipA couple of impression and feedback after two very stimulating days together with participants of the F2F A+FS working together on our new tools (results framework of the country strategy, annual report etc.) :I have experienced a lot of energy around “outcome reporting” some may argue that this is a consequence of the pressure currently experienced by our colleagues in country offices in using these tools … but as I am always an optimist I believe that it is also linked with an interest and a source of motivation we all have, in achieving outcomes and being able to report on it. Of course some people feel confused or “lost in transition”, but I am quite convinced that this is a normal step in a learning process.Another thing came out quite clearly: result orientation in the management of our programs requires deep unnrtseandidg of context realities, thematic expertise and good knowledge and practice of PCM methods, and these 3 areas cannot be separated. It would be very ineffective to have an absolute expert of the context, working with the best thematic specialist, joined by the top expert on PCM. They would probably have endless discussion about the preeminence of one aspect on the other. But we are far away from that and colleagues from country office and members of the A+FS network, have all strong backgrounds in the 3 areas. I have seen in a number of occasions during these two days colleagues using these 3 domains of their capacities in a very natural way, to reflect on finding a good indicator for example. I am convinced that the tools we have discussed will gradually be integrated in colleague’s own practice, because they will make sense and add value to their work.One important factor that will help this to happen is that we – in Head office, country offices and with our partners – gradually build a shared unnrtseandidg of this new way of working. For me this part of the F2F was an important contribution in this sense.One thing that gives me a nice feeling every time I meet with colleagues from different country offices is the strong impression that we share a lot for example in terms of our values, so that we are more than just colleagues, much more than other civil servant from the same administration … I take this opportunity thank all for the stimulating discussion that we had and say good bye to all, what I couldn’t do properly, when leaving Zolikofen. I wish you all a good time and the best when returning home!Laurent

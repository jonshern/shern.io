Over the past 2 years my primary media player has been [Itunes](http://www.itunes.com). For some reason the other day I thought it would be nice to check out [winamp](http://www.winamp.com) again. Some of the reason that I like winamp. **1**. Smart Views Beyond just having playlists you can have filtered views.  You can build whatever kind of  query that you want. Example: audio by Air longer than 4 minutes: type = 0 & artist = "air" & length > 4:00 These are an incredibly powerful way to segregate arrange your music. **2**. Audio CDs You can make audio cd's from within winamp.  Just drag some songs on the CD and voila and audio cd for your friends. **3**. It can sync pretty much any type of media player including ipod. **4**. It is winamp and not apple. Need I say more:)

I just noticed that when I type an invalid address my isp, Charter Communications is showing me their own 404 page. It has search results from yahoo, along with several search suggestions. 404 Products are pretty common as malware applications. They sit on your computer and watch all of your traffic, once they see a 404 they display their own page. Charter is now doing the same, everytime they see me hitting a 404 page they direct me to their page with a nice search suggestion. http://www11.charter.net/search?qo=www.dxfdsfsdfas.com&rn=MZ\_sFDrRNyrkhw5 ![Charter 404](http://www.shern.org/images/Charter404_A.JPG) It makes perfect sense, but at the same time if they are going to make money off of me, they should at least give me a portion of the cost savings. Instead they give 768kbps at a 1.5Mbps price, and for the people that have a 3.0Mbps you are just getting 1.5Mbps. **Giant rip off.** The City of St. Cloud gave Charter a nice gift by allowing them to buy Astound and create a complete cable monopoly. The only choice I have is Clearwire, which does not work at all in my apartment, and Qwest. I have heard good things about DSL, s0 I think I will go that route. The next step is for charter to send you to their search page every time you type in google, maybe give a helpful message like you typed "google" did you mean to type in "charter"

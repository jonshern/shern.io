I was browsing [codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com), and I came across this really cool application. [SameDesk](http://http://www.codeplex.com/samedesk) is an X windows for the browser environment, it allows for opening multiple web sites in a single browser window. It gives the user the ability to drag, minimize, maximize, etc. browser windows as if they were windowed applications.

This is some pretty cool stuff and the beta comes out soon. I can't wait to see where this great project goes.

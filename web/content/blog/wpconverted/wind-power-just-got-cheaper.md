Well technically everyone else's power got more expensive. ![](http://www.shern.org/images/WindBeforeFeb.jpg) ![](http://www.shern.org/images/WindAfterFeb.jpg) They are moving the fuel surcharge out, and making it an itemized charge instead of an adjustment. So now I will pay less for my power. And they announced they are [green-e certified](http://www.green-e.org) Looks like everyone should go with wind:)

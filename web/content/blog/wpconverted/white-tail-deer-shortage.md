AAccording to the MN DNR there are only two counties with a white-tail deer population. I know that in MN they sell Deer Hunting Licenses and hunters have to register after they shoot a deer, but apparently this app is separate from that. What would be the point of this application? It is obviously woefully inaccurate, I wonder how much tax money went into the development of this application and it's underlying data. In my opinion if that data is not refreshed and does not pass the common sense test, get rid of it. Who knows someone out there might be using this handy interactive map to make business decisions.

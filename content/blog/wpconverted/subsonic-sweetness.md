I started using subsonic a couple of weeks ago. I have really been impressed about how easy it is to setup and use. A few lines in your web.config, a reference to their dll, and .vbp file with the tables in it is all a person needs to get going with this time saving framework.  During the first build it will go out and produce classes for each of the tables.  There is a class for each table as well a collection for each table. Making a site that does some simple database stuff is made much easier using this framework.

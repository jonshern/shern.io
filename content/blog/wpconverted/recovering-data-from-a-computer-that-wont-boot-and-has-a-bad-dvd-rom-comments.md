I tried the 4200 router, and went thguorh 3 of them before I went to netgear. went to 3 different stores.. could not make either work. The net gears, had 2ï»¿ consecutive bad. Finally just went back to my WRT-54G. Works great. Now I am trying this unit. Since CISCO got away from external antennas, I will never go back to them.

Yesterday at the [PDC](http://microsoftpdc.com) Microsoft continued with their one screen one OS initiative and introduced Windows App Fabric, and [Codename Dallas](http://www.pinpoint.com/en-US/Dallas). Dallas is something of an information repository that you can go to, to find the data you would like to use. Once you found the data, you can browse the data. Connect to it using Excel. Slice and dice it with Excel. or Generate your own proxy class to process the data in code. Stay tuned, I plan on getting in on the CTP and developing something cool with the technology.

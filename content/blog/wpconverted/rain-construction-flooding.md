There has been a lot of construction around my apartment lately. This has led to a situation where the storm drains are not working properly During the big rain last night the street outside my apartment flooded. Someone happened to drive through it and stalled so I had to help push them out. ![St. Cloud Flooding](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1411/1111400680_b48a570515.jpg)

Mineapolis is currently making progress to bring wireless internet to its residents. The target timeframe is around the end of 2007 Part of the plan includes building portal pages that will serve as information hubs for each of the neighborhoods. It should be interesting to see how the city uses this infrastructure to cut costs and bring a paperless governement closer to reality.

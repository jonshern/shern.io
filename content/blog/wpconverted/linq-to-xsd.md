Linq to Xsd is one of microsofts many incubating projects. Sounds like a great technology. The question I am always faced with, is it worth it. Time is limited and there are plenty of technologies out there that are in production that I know almost nothing about. The ablility to access Xml in a strongly typed manner. Man that sounds like a no brainer. I understand that Microsoft is overcome with projects. Jeff Atwood wrote a great article on why [Microsoft Can't Go Open Source](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001144.html) I think this dove tails perfectly into the point that MS just spends too much time reinventing the wheel and not enough time introducing full featured development products. Linq is a great product. But why not release it with oracle support out of the box. I would love to pick up Linq to Xsd and run with it, but it seems like it just going to be another dead end.

Hi, a couple of quteoisns.Do you have a link to the High-Performance external antenna you show in the video ?If I choose to use such an antenna, whould I be needing 3 or just one ?Should I replace one of the standard antennas with this one, and keep the 2 others ?Regarding being unable to connect to the external IP, has this been fixed inï»¿ the 112 firmware ? I have a couple of webservers, and I need to be able to reach them on their DNS names which resolves to the external IP address.

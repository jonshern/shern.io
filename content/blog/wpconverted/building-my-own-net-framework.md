Now that Microsoft has revealed plans to release the [source](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx). I wonder if I will be able to download it and build it on my machine. Or is it strictly for debugging purposes? Maybe they will even allow us to access the current build and tinker with the new features:) That would be awesome. I can't wait to start utilizing this feature, it will be great to be able to see what kind of stuff microsoft is doing under the hood.

There are between 2301 and 3708 Wolves in Minnesota according the [wolf survey taken in 2004](http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/animals/mammals/wolves/2004_wolfsurvey_report.pdf), which is a 26% growth from the 1997-1998 numbers. ![The Timberwolf](http://images.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/animals/mammals/wolves/howling_wolf.jpg)Â  It seems pretty likely that Minnesota will eventually open up a wolf hunting season once they are removed from the Endangered Species List. The wolves are pretty staying up on the Arrowhead pennisula, so I think even if they do hunt a few wolves to control the population we will still maintain that signature boundary waters atmosphere. There is nothing like sitting on a peaceful rock, with a fishing pole in hand, listening to the wolves howl, and the loons sing.

I find it useful to create my own backup routine when I develop. I do this for easy dumping the data to an xml file, when I recreate the sql server. I find it easier to manage changes in the database, and converting data this way, rather than using a sql backup / dump file.But when I try to read the data back to the sql server using the entity framework I get a problem with the auto generated primary keys. It looks like, when I try to set the Id to a specific number, the sql server ignores it, and overwrites it with the auto generated number.Writing the entities to a xml file, with no relation, will of course break the relations if I can’t manually set the primary key to the original value.Any ideas on how I can manually set the primary key while running my restore script, and of course return to auto generated keys when I’m done?

Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. [Seo Plugin](http://www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com)

Writing articles is hard work, but i know what tool will save you a lot of time. This tool can also make you money, just search in google for: Haough's Essential Tool

Don't forget to add a reference to WindowsBase when you need to work with ObservableCollection in WPF.

I am a big fan of naming assemblies according to the contained namespace. That is why it always takes me a second to realize that System.Collection.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection<T> is in the WindowsBase namespace assembly.

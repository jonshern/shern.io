There are currently many choices for creating Mobile Applications.

1\. You can just create a website.

2\. You can create an app in each platform using Native Tools.

3\. You can use a Cross-Platform Solution that can reduce the coding necessary to deploy to all platforms.

The ones that I know about are

*   [Kony](http://www.kony.com/)
*   [Antenna](http://www.antennasoftware.com/)
*   [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/)
*   [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/)
*   [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/)

**If you like C# and want to use Visual Studio then [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) is the clear choice.**

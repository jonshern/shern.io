Since I am off to the [PDC](http://microsoftpdc.com/) in a few weeks I thought I would dust off my blog. What have I been up to you ask? Well for the last year and a half I have been at [Cargill Animal Nutrition](http://www.cargillanimalnutrition.com/). Working on the [Max System](http://www.cargilldairyfocus.com/). [Cargill launches enhanced MAX feed nutrition analysis system](http://www.agweb.com/DairyToday/Article.aspx?id=150015) [Max Program](http://www.cargillcs.com/Screens/ToolsAndTechnology/MAXProgram.aspx) The longer I am in technology, the more I realize that the technology is not the hard part, it is much harder learning what the business needs and figuring the right places to put technology.
